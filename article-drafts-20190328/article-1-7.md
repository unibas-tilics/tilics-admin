# Zero is not null 

The null value has a special meaning in computer science, it is used to declare that a value is not yet defined, known or exist. 
The speciality of null is, that altough it shows us that a value is missing, it is itself a value. So it is possible to compare two 
non existing values. For example null is useful for databases. Suppose we have a database of patient, 
it does make a different if a patient has not a disease (0) or is not yet diagnosed(null).
