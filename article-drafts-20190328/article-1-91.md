# Bayes Theorem: Updating Prior Beliefs With Data
One might argue that our standard way of reasoning consists of two basic elements: 
The initial belief we have about a topic and the step of updating of this belief when we observe something new. 

For example, you at first expect a deck of cards to be fair when playing a game of poker. But after observing four straight flushes in a row, it is natural to believe that the game has been tempered with.
And if you actually expected the other players to be sketchy beforehand, you would come to that conclusion  way faster.

This basic idea is formalized in Bayes' Theorem, forming the basis of many Statistics and Machine Learning methods.
It allows the inclusion of expert prior knowledge into a model instead of only basing it on data. We can for example include the notion of faces being roughly symmetrical when building face recognition models.
And if enough data that contradicts this assumption is observed, the model will still be able to ignore this potentially incorrect prior belief.

## Optional
So even if we initially believe Computer Science to be about fixing Computers, learning more about it will eventually make that idea vanish.

## Note
I'm not really happy with the poker example, I think there should be way better examples..
