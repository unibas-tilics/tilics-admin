# Bayes Theorem: Updating Prior Beliefs With Data
One might argue that our standard way of reasoning consists of two basic elements: 
The initial belief we have about a topic and the step of updating of this belief when we observe something new. For example, we at first expect a deck of cards to be fair when playing a game of poker. But after observing two straight flushes in a row, it is natural to believe that a fair deck is very improbable.

This basic idea of updating beliefs is formalized in the so-called Bayes' Theorem.
When observing new evidence, prior probabilities of an event are updated to the posterior probability . 
With this, it is possible to include expert prior knowledge into a model instead of only basing it on data. 
We can for example include the notion of faces being symmetrical when building face recognition models.

However, if enough data that contradicts this assumption is observed, the model will still be able to ignore this potentially incorrect prior assumption.

## Optional
So even if we initially believe Computer Science to be about fixing Computers, learning more about it will surely change that.

## Note
I'm not really happy with the poker example, I think there should be way better examples..
