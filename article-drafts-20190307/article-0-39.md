A computer stores everything with 1s and 0s. To encode any number as a String of 1s and 0s you use the binary system. 
It is similar to the deciaml system normal humans use but it has only two figures 1 and 0. In decimal you have the base 10 and can rewrite 
the number 1337_dec as 1\*10^3+3\*10^2+3\*10^1+7\*10^0. In binary the number 1101_bin can be representet as 1\*2^3+1\*2^2+0\*2^1+1\*2^0=13_dec.
the are also other systems like hexadecimal with the 16 figures 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,E,F and the octal system with the figures from 0 to 7.
To get from one system to the other you devide by the base with remainder until you reach 0. Then you string the remainders backwards together.

## Optional text
Don't worry. The 101 in the title was in decimal. We are not done yet.
