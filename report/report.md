# The making of *Things I Learned in Computer Science*

Studying Computer Science is like taking a deep dive into a seemingly endless ocean of ideas, concepts, and tools. It is a vast ecosystem where everything is interconnected, where exploring one thing opens doors to a plethora of other, equally interesting, things. Software engineering, information theory, computer networks, and artificial intelligence, are only a few of the subcategories that together form the discipline of computer science. 

It is easy to get lost in this wide landscape, even more so if it is not ones main field of expertise. This is why Computer Science students of the University of Basel set out to create a small collection of illustrated articles about the essential things they learned during their studies: *Things I Learned in Computer Science* is made for people outside of our field. With this series of texts, we want to  convey what we consider to be the essential lessons we learned while exploring this science. 

## The idea

The initial idea for this seminar is based on popular series of booklets such as *101 Things I learned in {Art School, Engineering School,...}*. These books present a particular discipline or field by means of small illustrated articles about its fundamental concepts. To this date there is, however, no such book about Computer Science. Filling this gap, was the motivation to organize the Master's-level seminar *101 Things I Learned in Compuer Science*.

The goal of this exercise was to reflect our *d√©formation professionelle* as computer scientists and identify the concepts and ideas that most significantly formed our minds during our studies. As a result of this thought process, we produced a small booklet of illustrated articles about some of the lessons learned.

## Getting organized

Since it was the first time this seminar was offered, there was no well defined roadmap yet. How to create a book whithin one semester? What exactly should be its content? How to make a manuscript ready for publication? It was part of the brainstorming sessions at the beginnig of the seminar to find answers to these questions. As it turned out we already had a rough plan after the first 2 sessions. Achieving the ambitious goal set by the seminar description seemed doable.

Several core tasks were identified and assigned to groups of 1-3 people. These are: assembling and clustering the list of topics to cover in the book, finding the appropriate tools used in the process, reviewing the submitted manuscripts, creating illustrations for the book and collecting feedback from the public.

One of the lessons we learned during our studies is that teamwork is essential. In a broader sense, this also applies to the sharing of knowledge. This is why it was decided that whatever would come out at the end of the process should be published under a Creative Commons license.

## A well-oiled process

To keep track of the workflow, it was decided to use a Github repository. Every article was keep in a separate branch and submitted by opening a pull-request. The process of reviewing and editing was organized by assigning labels to the respective pull-requests. Discussions took place in the comments section. 

After submission by its author, an article was discussed in the seminar plenum and reviewed by the review team. The author then edited the article to address the issues raised during the discussion. As soon as the article was conceptually done, the grpahics team started to crate an illustration. At this step, some of the articles were selected for public testing. The last step an article had to go through was the proof-reading by the grammar group. 

The process was assessed in weekly scrum-style meetings. This was also an opportunity for the group to discuss the content of the articles created by their fellow students. As the requirements for the book creation process were not know in advance, the workfow was adjusted as needed.
