# Things I Learned in Computer Science

Studying Computer Science is like taking a deep dive into a seemingly endless ocean of ideas, concepts, and tools. It is a vast ecosystem where everything is interconnected, where exploring one thing opens doors to a plethora of other, equally interesting, things. Software engineering, information theory, computer networks, and artificial intelligence, are only a few of the subcategories that together form the discipline of computer science. 

It is easy to get lost in this wide landscape, even more so if it is not ones main field of expertise. This is why Computer Science students of the University of Basel set out to create a small collection of illustrated articles about the essential things they learned during their studies:

*Things I Learned in Computer Science* is made for people outside of our field. With this series of texts, we want to  convey what we consider to be the essential lessons we learned while exploring this science. The goal of this exercise was to reflect our *d√©formation professionelle* as Computer Scientists and identify the concepts and ideas that most significantly formed our minds during our studies. As a result of this thought process, we produced a small booklet of illustrated articles about some of the lessons learned.



The following report summarizes the process of creating this booklet.



## 1. The brainstorming

- initial idea
- goals

## 2. Getting organized

- the setting (weekly seminar, limited time frame,... )
- licensing

## 3. A well-oiled process

- sub-groups
- scrum-style meetings
- "agile development" 
- tests/feedback
