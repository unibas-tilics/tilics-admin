# Spot the Difference! Then Patch your Program! Now you are up to date.

It's easy to overlook small differences, so computer programmers were
quick at creating a tool that finds _all_ differences. Unlike puzzles
for kids which work with images, program developers compare _programs_.

Why this? Describing the difference between a buggy program and the
improved version produces a so called _patch_ i.e. a collection of
changes that have to be applied to copies of the buggy program.

In practice, your computer or smartphone is patched all the time, where
it's called an _update_. Usually only the difference is sent to you,
not a full copy of the improved program.
