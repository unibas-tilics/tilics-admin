# Always use a Version Control System

It's no secret that backing up your data is a good idea, and the same goes for your code. 
However, uploading slightly renamed versions of your files to the cloud storage of choice is probably not the best solution. 

Version Control Systems (VCS) allow not only to back up your files, 
but also help you to keep track of the different versions and what changed in each of them. 
Even better, multiple people can work at the time on one file and then easily merge the different changes.

## Optional
Trivia: The whole writing and reviewing process of this book was actually managed with a VCS.

## Note
Image still to be done, but I've already got a rough idea.
